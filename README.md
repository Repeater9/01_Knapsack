# 01_Knapsack
We use "Branch and Bound", "Dynamic Programming", "Backtracking" and "Greedy Methods" to solve Knapsack problem.

Each function is declared in class *Knapsack* and defined in different cpp files.

To test the program, just modify function 'main' in file main.cpp and then type 'make run' in the command line.

To clean all xxxx.o files, just type 'make clean' (You need to have make.exe in Windows Operating system)
